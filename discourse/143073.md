Here is a markdown description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture of a result after submitting a quiz or an assignment. The top part reads:

"Score: 100/100
This score will not be considered for evaluation."

The next section is labeled "Console Output" and contains the following information:

*   The text "on "Submit" button" indicates that the output was generated upon pressing the "Submit" button.
*   The source data for the questions is located at a Google Drive folder with the link: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-ow9zTzFClpvDj3PyR3elJpWdaeeV2k?usp=sharing"
*   The submission, as parsed by the system, is a dictionary-like structure containing responses to questions, as follows:
    *   'Q6': "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1)"
    *   'Q10': 824318
    *   'Q7': 342
    *   'Q11': 8352
    *   'Q9': "The Fever"
    *   'Q4': "Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon, #1)"
    *   'Q1': 78
    *   'Q8': 21615
    *   'Q3': 51715
    *   'Q14': 1559

*   Finally, there is a message: "Your submission has wrong answers. Please recheck the submission"

The score shows 100/100, but the message indicates that the submission has wrong answers, and the score will not be considered for evaluation.
