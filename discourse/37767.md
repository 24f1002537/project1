Here's the breakdown to determine which code snippet generates the displayed Streamlit app:

**Understanding the Displayed App**

*   **Title:** "Tools for DataScience" (appears larger and bolder).
*   **Description:** A paragraph that starts with "This course will teach students..."

**Analyzing the Code Snippets**

*   **Option 1:**

    *   `st.write("""# Tools for DataScience""")`:  The `#` symbol within `st.write` is Markdown syntax for a large heading.
    *   `st.write("""This course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, building and optimizing models, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.""")`: This will render the paragraph.
    *   **Problem:** `st.write` displays everything in the same formatting. The title text would be in slightly smaller size.

*   **Option 2:**

    *   `st.title("Tools for DataScience")`: This correctly sets the main title of the app with the intended format.
    *   `st.write("This course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, building and optimizing models, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.")`: Displays the descriptive text.
    *   **This code will reproduce the image.**

*   **Option 3:**

    *   `st.title("Tools for DataScience")`: Correct for main title.
    *   `st.markdown("This course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, building and optimizing models, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.")`: Displays the descriptive text.
    *   **Problem:** While st.markdown can also display texts, but st.write is better suitable to generate the specific text format that we can see in the image.

**Conclusion**

Option 2 is the code snippet that accurately generates the shown Streamlit app display.

**Therefore, the correct answer is the second option**
