The image shows a terminal session in a Linux environment. The user, identified as `21f3003123@se2001`, is working in the directory `/opt/se2001/assignment_1`.

The initial commands executed are `ls` and `cat README.md`. `ls` lists the contents of the current directory, showing the files `evaluation_file.sh` and `README.md`. `cat README.md` displays the content of the `README.md` file, which contains instructions for an assignment.

The assignment involves writing a script named `script.sh` to download the file `sample_1.txt` from `http://local.server` and save it as `s1.txt` in the directory `~/se2001/assignment_1/`.  The `wget` command is suggested as a hint. The optional part of the assignment involves downloading `sample_2.txt`, `sample_3.txt`, and `sample_4.txt` using `curl`.

The user then attempts to create the `script.sh` file using the `touch` command, but this fails with a "Permission denied" error. The user subsequently tries to create the file with superuser privileges using `sudo touch script.sh`. However, the user `21f3003123` is not in the `sudoers` file, so the command fails, and an incident is reported.
