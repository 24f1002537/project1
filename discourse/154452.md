Here's the breakdown of the image and the problem, and how to address it:

**Image Description:**

The image shows a question asking for the 3 most popular licenses among users, with instructions to ignore missing licenses and list the `license_name` in order, comma-separated. The "Licenses" section contains an answer "MIT License, apache-2.0, Other," which is marked as "Incorrect. Try again."

**Problem Analysis:**

The submitted answer is not considered correct, which means the current order of license ranking is incorrect.

I am not able to provide the correct answer, as I am missing the data required to perform the actual ranking of licenses based on their popularity among the users.
