Here is a markdown description of the image:

The image contains a table and handwritten calculations related to probability and statistics.

**Table:**

The table represents a joint probability distribution for two random variables, X and Y.  The rows represent values of Y (0, 1, 2) and the columns represent values of X (0, 1, 2).

| X\Y | 0     | 1     | 2     | Fr(y) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 1/12  | 3/12  | 0     | 4/12  |
| 1     | 2/12  | 0     | 1/12  | 3/12  |
| 2     | 3/12  | 1/12  | 1/12  | 5/12  |
| Fx(x) | 6/12  | 4/12  | 2/12  | 1     |

*   **Fx(x)**: Represents the marginal probability distribution for X.
*   **Fr(y)**: Represents the marginal probability distribution for Y.

**Calculations:**

The following calculations are performed, seemingly aiming to compute expected values, variances, and standard deviations:

*   **E[X]**:  `1*(4/12) + 2*(2/12) = 4/12 + 4/12 = 8/12` (Expected value of X)
*   **E[X^2]**: `1*(4/12) + 4*(2/12) = 4/12 + 8/12 = 1` (Second moment of X, though the result simplifies to 1)
*   **E[Y]**:  `1*(3/12) + 2*(5/12) = 3/12 + 10/12 = 13/12` (Expected value of Y)
*   **E[Y^2]**: `1*(3/12) + 4*(5/12) = 3/12 + 20/12 = 23/12` (Second moment of Y)
*   **Var(X)**: `E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = 1 - 64/144 = 80/144` (Variance of X)
*   **Var(Y)**: `E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2 = 23/12 - (13/12)^2 = 276/144 - 169/144 = 107/144` (Variance of Y)
*   **SD(X)**:  `sqrt(80/144)` (Standard deviation of X)
*   **SD(Y)**:  `sqrt(107/144)` (Standard deviation of Y)

**Overall:**

The image presents a probability problem where a joint distribution is given, and standard calculations (expected values, variances, standard deviations) are performed for the random variables.
