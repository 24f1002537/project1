Here is a detailed description of the image in markdown format:

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser's developer tools, specifically the "Network" tab. The web browser is likely Google Chrome, based on the interface. The top of the screen displays a Google search bar with the text "how to" partially typed in. Below the search bar, a dropdown list of popular search queries beginning with "how to" is visible, including items like:

*   how to use cdc voucher
*   how to screenshot on windows
*   how to wrap a gift
*   how to screenshot on mac
*   how to recall email in outlook
*   how to delete instagram account
*   how to lose weight fast
*   how to redeem cdc voucher
*   how to wish merry christmas

The developer tools are open at the bottom of the screen. The "Network" tab is selected. Underneath, there's a search bar with text entered. A list of network requests is displayed, including items starting with "gen_204?atyp" and "images?q=tbn". One of the entries, "search?q=how%20to%20", is highlighted.

On the right side of the developer tools, details of the selected network request are shown. Under the "General" section, the following information is visible:

*   Request URL: `https://www.google.com/complete/search?q=how%20to%20%20&cp=8&client-gws-wiz&xssi=t&hl=en-S&authuser=0&psi=5pLGYcW7Gcjbz7sPvPCrkAQ.1648403687344&dpr=1`
*   Request Method: GET
*   Status Code: 200
*   Remote Address: 74.125.68.103:443
*   Referrer Policy: origin

At the top right corner of the image, there's a logo that says "IIT Madras BSc Degree".

The scene seems to be capturing a process where someone is analyzing the network requests made by the browser when a user types a search query in Google.
