Here's a description of the image in markdown format:

The image shows a terminal interface in a Linux environment. The prompt indicates the user is 'priyadarsh99' on a system named 'priyadarsh99-VirtualBox'.

The first command executed is `pwd`, which prints the current working directory as `/home/priyadarsh99`.

Next, the command `ls -l` lists the contents of the directory in long format.  The output shows several standard directories like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates, and Videos. There's also a directory called `level1`.  The file permissions for these directories are `drwxr-xr-x`, except for `level1` which has permissions `drwxrwxr-x`.

After that, the user changes the directory to the parent directory using `cd ..`.  This moves the user from `/home/priyadarsh99` to `/home`.

Finally, the user attempts to create a new directory named 'first' using `mkdir first`. However, the operation fails with the error message "mkdir: cannot create directory 'first': Permission denied". This indicates that the user does not have the necessary permissions to create a directory in `/home`.  The final prompt indicates the current working directory is now `/home`.
