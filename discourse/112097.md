Here's an analysis of the provided code and statements:

**Code Analysis:**

The Python code defines a Flask web application with two routes:

*   `/about`:  Handles `GET` requests and returns "Hello, World!" wrapped in a `<p>` tag.
*   `/home/`: Handles `POST` requests and returns "You are now on home page" wrapped in an `<h1>` tag.

**Statement Evaluation:**

Let's evaluate each statement, considering that you are accessing these routes using a standard web browser (which primarily makes `GET` requests unless specifically instructed to `POST`):

*   **A. Whenever we hit the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/about/", the browser will show "404 Not found" error.** This is incorrect. The `/about` route is defined to handle `GET` requests, which is what a browser will use by default. The route exists, so a 404 error will not occur. Instead, the response from the `hello_world` function will be displayed.

*   **B. Whenever we hit the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/about/", the browser will display "Hello, World!".** This is correct.  The browser sends a `GET` request to `/about`, and the `hello_world` function returns "<p>Hello, World!</p>". The browser will render this HTML, displaying "Hello, World!".

*   **C. Whenever we hit the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/home/" using the browser, it will show "Method Not Allowed" error.** This is correct. Browsers generally use `GET` requests by default when you type a URL into the address bar. The `/home/` route *only* accepts `POST` requests. Therefore, trying to access it with a `GET` request will result in a "Method Not Allowed" error (HTTP 405).

*   **D. Whenever we hit the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/home/" using the browser, it will display "You are now on home page".** This is incorrect.  As explained above, a standard browser request to `/home/` will be a `GET` request, which the route does not handle.

**Summary:**

*   **A is false**
*   **B is true**
*   **C is true**
*   **D is false**
