Here's a breakdown of the image content and the reasoning behind the answer:

**Image Content:**

The image presents a question related to a YAML file defining an OpenAPI specification. The YAML file includes basic information such as:

*   `openapi`: Version of the OpenAPI specification
*   `info`: Details like the title and version of the API.
*   `paths`:  An empty object `{}`.

**Question:**

The question asks: "How many endpoints are defined in the given YAML file?"

**Answer and Reasoning:**

The `paths` section in the YAML file defines the API endpoints. In this case, `paths: {}` indicates that the paths section is empty.  This signifies that no endpoints are defined in this particular YAML file. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
