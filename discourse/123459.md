Here is a markdown description of the image:

The image is a promotional graphic for IIT Madras's online degree program in Programming & Data Science. The IIT Madras logo is in the upper left corner, featuring a stylized oil lamp (diya) within a circle bearing the institution's name in English and Sanskrit.

To the right of the logo is the text "IIT Madras" in large, bold black font. Below this, "ONLINE DEGREE" is written in a smaller, light-colored font against a golden rectangle background. "Programming & Data Science" appears below that in the same light color.

At the bottom of the image, against a red background, is the phrase "Learn at your pace, from anywhere, within & outside India." This phrase is preceded by a small checkmark symbol.
