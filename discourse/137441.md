## Image Description

The image shows code snippets for a Vue.js application, specifically the content of `index.html`.

**Text:**

The image contains the following text:

*   "Consider the following Vue application with markup index.html and JavaScript app.js"
*   "index.html"

**Code:**

The `index.html` file contains the following HTML:

```html
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2/dist/vue.js"></script>
  <script src="./app.js"></script>
</body>
```

**Structure:**

The `index.html` file includes:

1.  An empty `div` element with the ID "app", which is intended to be the root component of the Vue.js application.
2.  A script tag that loads Vue.js from a CDN. This provides the Vue.js library to the webpage.
3.  A script tag that loads `app.js`, which is assumed to contain the Vue.js application logic.  The relative path indicates `app.js` is in the same directory as `index.html`.
```
