Here is a markdown description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture from an online platform, likely related to a test or game.

At the top, within a red banner, it states: "Ended at Sun, 18 May, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" followed by "Score: 0". To the right, there are two buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save".

Below the banner, there's a dark green section with the heading "Recent saves" and the subtext "(most recent is your official score)".

Underneath the heading, there are three entries, each providing information about past saves:

1.  "Reload" from 12/05/2025, 18:59:46. Score: 9.5
2.  "Reload" from 12/05/2025, 18:59:44. Score: 9.5
3.  "Reload" from 12/05/2025, 18:59:42. Score: 9.5

Each entry has a "Reload" button, followed by the date and time of the save, and the corresponding score. The scores are consistently 9.5 across all saves.
