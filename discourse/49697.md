Here's a markdown description of the image:

The image displays Python code written in an online editor. The code is designed to calculate and print the sum of prime numbers within a given range [1, n], where 'n' is a positive integer input by the user. If no prime numbers exist within the specified range, the program prints '0'.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

*   **Lines 1-4:** These are comments explaining the purpose of the code.
*   **Line 5:** Takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable 'n'.
*   **Line 6:** Checks if 'n' is greater than 1.
*   **Line 7:** Initializes a variable 'sum' to 2 (since 2 is the first prime number).
*   **Line 8:** Starts a loop that iterates from 1 to 'n-1'.
*   **Line 9:** Sets a flag variable 'flag' to False for each number being checked.
*   **Line 10:** Starts an inner loop that iterates from 2 up to the current number 'i' being checked.
*   **Line 11:** Checks if 'i' is divisible by 'j' (i.e., if the remainder of i/j is 0).
*   **Line 12:** If 'i' is divisible by 'j', the 'flag' is set to False, indicating that 'i' is not a prime number.
*   **Line 13:** The inner loop is broken if a divisor is found.
*   **Line 14-15:** If the inner loop completes without finding a divisor, the 'else' block is executed, setting the 'flag' to True, indicating that 'i' is a prime number.
*   **Line 16:** Checks if the 'flag' is True (i.e., if the number is prime).
*   **Line 17:** If 'flag' is True, the current number 'i' is added to the 'sum'.
*   **Line 18:** Prints the final 'sum' of prime numbers.
*   **Line 19:** The 'else' block corresponding to the 'if(n>1)' condition.
*   **Line 20:** Prints '0' if 'n' is not greater than 1.

The code is functional but can be optimized for efficiency.
