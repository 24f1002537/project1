Here's a description of the image in markdown format:

The image shows an email indicating the requirements and evaluation for a Project 1. 

**Email Content:**

The email starts with "Dear Learner," and explains that Project 1 requires passing pre-requisite checks detailed on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page (linked in the image).

It lists the following prerequisites:

1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`
5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.

It states that failing to meet the minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

**Prerequisite Evaluation:**

The email then provides the following evaluations:

*   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
*   Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
*   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
*   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

**Project Status:**

Based on the evaluation, the email indicates:

*   Prerequisites: FAIL
*   Project 1 Score: 0

This suggests that the student failed the prerequisites due to the missing MIT license.
