Here's a description of the image in markdown format:

The image shows a pop-up window indicating an error during a test case.

**Elements:**

*   **Top Left:** "X Case 2" in a light reddish box indicates the failed test case.
*   **Title:** "Actual Output"
*   **Error Message:** "Your output does not match expected output."
*   **Expected Output:** "Expected ouput (type: str):'\[image of python logo]Python Logo'"
*   **Your Output:** "Your output (type: str): '\[image of python logo]Python Logo'"
*   **Top Right:** An "X" icon for closing the window.
*   **Center right:** icon of two overlapping squares

**Description:**

The pop-up is a feedback message after running a code test. It indicates that the output generated by the code does not match the expected output. Although the text representations of the output appear identical (both showing the Python logo and the text "Python Logo"), there is an unseen difference that causes the test to fail. This could be a subtle difference like whitespace, capitalization, or a special character that is not visually apparent.
