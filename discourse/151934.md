The image presents a multiple-choice question related to geographic data and specifically uses the Nominatim API (a popular tool for reverse geocoding).

**Question:**

"What is the maximum latitude of the bounding box of the city Wuhan in the country China on the Nominatim API? Pick the osm_id ending with 7255."

**Answer Choices:**

*   31.70076
*   32.70076
*   30.70076
*   33.70076
