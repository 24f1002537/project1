*   Navigation links for "Course," "Scores," "Announcements," and "Forum" are present.
*   A calculator icon is visible on the right side of the header.
*   The logged-in user's email address is displayed.

    *   Module 5a: Deep learning models
    *   Module 5b: Deep learning models (contd)
    *   Module 6a: Design your output
    *   Module 6b: Design your output
    *   Module 7: Narrate a story

*   "Project 1 Submission" and "Project 2 Submission" are listed as programming assignments. Project 1 seems to be submitted (indicated by a blue icon), while Project 2 isn't (indicated by a red warning symbol).
*   A "Podcast" module is also listed.

*   The visible portion of the main content is focused on submitting a programming assignment for Project 2.
    *   A message informs the user that the assignment has public test cases and emphasizes using the "Test Run" button and submitting with the "Submit" button.
    *   The submission interface includes:
        *   A file selection field labeled "Select your zip file" with a "Choose File" button.
        *   A display indicating "No file chosen."
        *   "Test Run Score: 100/100" with the note "This score will not be saved."
        *   A section titled "Test Run Result" displaying:
            *   Format Check1: The file length is as expected.
            *   Format Check2: The format of questions in the file is as expected
            *   WRONG DATA FORMAT: Please verify if the data format for each question.
            *   Disclaimer: The evaluation will be done after the due date, the test results being indicative of file format alone.
            *   Instruction to cross-check and submit using the "Submit" button.

**General Observations:**

*   The user has already run a test run for the submission, achieving a perfect score, but the result isn't saved until a formal submission.
*   The test run results highlight data format concerns.
*   The user is in the process of potentially submitting their project.
