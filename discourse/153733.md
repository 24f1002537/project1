Here is a description of the image in markdown format:

The image shows a screenshot of an email message on a mobile device. The email is addressed to "Dear Student Support" and expresses concern about a discrepancy in the deadline for a Week 4 assignment in the TDS subject.

The email states that the email notification originally listed the deadline as October 25, 2024, at 23:59 hrs (11:59 PM). However, the portal showed a deadline of 05:29 on the same day, which resulted in the assignment being automatically submitted before it could be completed. The sender believes this led to lower marks than expected.

The sender kindly requests assistance in reviewing the matter and asks if there is any possibility to resubmit the assignment or have the issue resolved. The sender then thanks the recipient for their support and mentions that screenshots of the email and portal are included for reference.

The top of the image shows the device's status bar, including the time (10:16), network connection information, and battery level (88%). The bottom of the image shows navigation buttons. Below the email message, there is another timestamp (9:58) and more mobile navigation buttons.
